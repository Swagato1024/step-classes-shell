File system 

Table          INODE_ID
.....          ........
file_name1      2012
filename2       2023

Soft Links
................
ls -s

in case of soft links , our new file gets new INODE_Id

ls -il -- shows INODE_ID

while linking a file provide the abs path of our source file

if we delete the original file, our newly created linked file will not work


Hard Links
.............
in case of hard link the same INODE_ID is assigned to the new file .

in INODE how many files are hard link to that file is maintained. when that counter becomes zero , file gets deleted

so, if there are two hard link to a Inode , and we delete one of them , we can still use that file 

in case of mv

mv file1 file2

now file1 and file2 has the same Inode_id.

before mv

file1    2324

after mv

file2   2324


....................................................

in every file system there is a special space where we store INODEs
