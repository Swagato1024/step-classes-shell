--------------------------------------------------

1. create backup.sh which will give customized error if some wrong path is passed .
backup.sh will take backup location as an optional argument . default backup location is ~/.backup

 if[ $STRING ] checks STRINGS != NULL
 if [ !$STRING ] echo " string is empty "


2. create my own backup command and add it to PATH .

3. do same with restore.sh . default restore location is PWD.

4. while restoring , create a directory  as the archive name and put archive there.
