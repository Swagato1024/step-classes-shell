tar command with -C . 
-C : change directory


Backup

# Every thing including hidden files of pwd will be archived in archive_timestamp.tar.gz
tar cvfz ~/backup/archive_name_timestamp.tar.gz   .

# Now I want to archive a directory named to_archive . "to_archive" is not my pwd

1. tar cvfz ~/backup/archive_name_timestamp.tar.gz  ~/project/tar_command/to_archive

In this case archive_name_timestamp.tar.gz will be created .
But when we will extract archive_name_timestamp.tar.gz , we can see that our archive file has been created inside /User/swagatochakraborty/project/tar_command . To avoid this, we will use -C



 
2. tar cvfz ~/backup/archive_name_timestamp.tar.gz  -C ~/project/tar_command/to_archive .

 This means change directoy to ~/project/project/tar_command/to_archive and then archive all the contents of that directory


 Restore

 1. tar xfvz ~/backup/archive_name_timestamp.tar.gz 
  
  extract the archive file in pwd



 2. tar xfvz ~/backup/archive_name_timestamp.tar.gz -C ~/project/restore_path
   
   restore the archive file at restore path.
